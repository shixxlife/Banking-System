# Banking-System
My program will simulate a banking system with the following functionalities:
1. Account Creation – Users can create a new bank account.
2. Transactions – Users can deposit and withdraw money.
3. Interest Calculation – The system can compute interest on balances.
4. Last 5 Transactions – Users can view their most recent transactions.
5. Balance Inquiry – Users can check their current balance.
6. EMI Calculation – The system can calculate Equated Monthly Installments (EMI) for loans.
